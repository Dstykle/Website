 <p style=font-size:110%>In case you have never tried <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/meal/chicken-mcnuggets-10-piece-meal.html" target="_blank">McDonald's Chicken Nuggets</a>, 
 I would <mark>highly</mark> recommend you go try some before looking at this article anymore. McDonald's has some of 
 the most <ins><b>crispiest</b></ins> nuggets which make it 1000% more better than any other companies nuggets. They offer from a 
 4-piece to a 40-piece in case you might really be feeling some chicken nuggets that day.<br><br></p>

 <p style=font-size:110%>Okay, <a href="https://www.bk.com/menu/picker-picker_5545" target="_blank">Burger King Nuggets</a> are somewhat good but in my opinion they really miss the juiciness of the nugget when you take 
  your first bite. 9 times out of 10 you will probably much better enjoy some nuggets from a different restaurant.</a>
